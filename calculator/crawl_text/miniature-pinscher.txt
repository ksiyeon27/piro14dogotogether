The Miniature Pinscher is very active and athletic, and requires ample exercise. A couple of good walks with his human every day will help ensure his optimum mental and physical health. He can enjoy relaxing on the sofa with his owner but will be equally eager to go outside and chase a few tennis balls or run around and play.
