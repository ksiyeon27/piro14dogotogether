The athletic, exuberant Pointer is a very active sporting breed and requires lots of exercise every day to keep him healthy and happy. This can come in the form of long daily walks and vigorous play sessions with his owner. Providing a securely fenced yard where the Pointer can run full out and burn off some of his renowned “hunt all day” endurance is beneficial and will make for a calmer, more contented companion inside the home. The breed also exercises mind and body by participating in canine sports such as field events, obedience, tracking, agility, rally, and other activities that can be enjoyed by dog and owner.
