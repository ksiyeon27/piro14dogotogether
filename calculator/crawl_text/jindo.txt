The Jindo is a high-energy hunting and guard dog with impeccable house manners. They were developed as a serious hunting dog capable of traveling many miles and taking down small and large game. This very athletic breed requires a reasonable amount of physical and mental stimulation. Be it guarding acreage or performing tricks for the neighbors’ kids, Jindos love having a job to do and their needs are fairly easily met in an active household. They enjoy sports like lure coursing and agility, have run on sled dog teams, and are happy to turn their athleticism to any active task, even if that task is simply a nice long walk.
Inside the home, Jindos are polite and attentive. They will often follow their owner from room to room, not being clingy but happy to curl up in a corner where they can simply be near and watch over their person or family. If given an active outlet, they seldom bother anything in the home that is not theirs, and they are not a destructive breed.
