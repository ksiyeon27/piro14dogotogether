Shelties are active and athletic, and while they need a moderate amount of exercise they are also very adaptable to their familyâ€™s way of life. They do well as city dogs as long as owners provide sufficient exercise. They enjoy outings with their people that will exercise both their mind and body. Shelties enjoy and excel in many canine events, including obedience, agility, herding, and tracking, and they shine as therapy dogs.
