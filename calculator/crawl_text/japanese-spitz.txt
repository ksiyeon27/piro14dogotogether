The Japanese Spitz adapts to many environments. They do well with lots of room to run like on farms and ranches, but also fare well in little spaces like apartments. Either way, they do need regular exercise and enjoy being with their families. A free, interactive run outside or a nice daily walk will benefit them physically and mentally. Afterwards, they will be glad to climb up on the sofa with you while you read or watch TV. An essential thing to remember about Japanese Spitz is that they are companion dogs; they just want you to spend time with them and they will make you laugh and smile in return.
