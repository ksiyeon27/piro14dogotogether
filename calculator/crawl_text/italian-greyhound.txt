IGs are an active breed and need regularÂ exercise. For the most part, playtime will be sufficient for this, especially if there is more than one dog. Walks on lead are appreciated. Dog parks can be a hazard unless well supervised and having separate areas for small dogs. Even obedience-trained IGs should not be allowed off lead outdoors in unfenced areas, since small, moving animals are a huge incentive to run, possibly into danger.
